# Full Stack JavaScript Application Stack

This guide outlines the best frameworks and technologies to build a full stack JavaScript application in 2025. It includes frontend, backend, database, and essential development tools.

---

## 🌐 Frontend

These tools are used to build the client-side (user interface) of the application.

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **React.js** — Most popular UI library, supported by Meta. Fast, component-based.
- **Next.js** — React-based framework for full-stack apps with SSR, routing, and API support.
- **Vue.js** — Lightweight and beginner-friendly alternative to React.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI design.

### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit** — Predictable state management for React.
- **Zustand / Jotai / Recoil** — Modern lightweight state managers.

---

## 🚀 Backend

For server-side logic, APIs, and database handling.

### Node.js Frameworks
- **Express.js** — Lightweight, flexible, and widely used web framework for Node.js.
- **Fastify** — Fast and modern alternative to Express.js.
- **NestJS** — TypeScript-first full-featured framework, heavily inspired by Angular.

### API & Auth
- **GraphQL** — Flexible alternative to REST, used with Apollo Server.
- **tRPC** — End-to-end typesafe API layer (great with Next.js).
- **JWT / Passport.js** — For user authentication and session management.

---

## 🗃️ Database

Store and manage app data.

### SQL
- **PostgreSQL** — Open-source, reliable, and scalable.
- **MySQL** — Well-established SQL database.

### NoSQL
- **MongoDB** — Flexible schema, document-based, easy to use with Mongoose.

### ORMs & Query Builders
- **Prisma** — Modern TypeScript ORM, works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.
- **Mongoose** — ODM for MongoDB.
- **Knex.js** — SQL query builder.

---

## ⚙️ Dev Tools & Deployment

Improve development workflow and deploy your app.

### Build Tools
- **Vite** — Lightning-fast bundler for modern frontend.
- **Webpack** — Configurable bundler (more complex).

### Testing
- **Jest** — Unit testing for JavaScript and React.
- **Vitest** — Vite-native unit testing framework.

### CI/CD & Deployment
- **GitHub Actions** — Automate testing, build, and deploy processes.
- **Vercel** — Perfect for deploying Next.js apps.
- **Render / Railway / Fly.io** — Full-stack app deployment platforms.
- **Docker** — Containerization for app environments.

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Helmet.js** — Secures Express apps by setting HTTP headers.
- **Rate Limiting** — `express-rate-limit` for throttling.
- **CSRF Protection** — `csurf` middleware for Express apps.

---

## 🧪 Bonus Tools

- **Storybook** — UI component explorer for React/Vue.
- **ESLint & Prettier** — Code linting and formatting.
- **Husky** — Git hooks for automated checks.

---

## 🌈 Recommended Stack Example

**Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js (Express or NestJS)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma  
**Auth:** NextAuth.js or Passport.js  
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend/database)
